# Multi-Saves-Game-Launcher
Game Launcher supports multiple save profiles, for the games that don't do it by default.
I have made this Launcher for Assassin's Creed Unity especially, but it works on many other games too.

## Usage
If anyone interested to use this program, please follow the following steps:
1. First of all, change the paths in *src/application/GameFilesPaths.java* and write the path of the executable game file, and the directory of the saves folder in your machine.
1. Export a jar file using *src/application/MainClass.java*.
1. Create an executable file and give it administration privilege, so the program be able to back up the save files as explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22110928).
#### Note 
I will try to make the usage process easier in the future by asking the user to enter the paths using GUI once I am free. 

## Built With

* Eclipse using Java as a programming language.
* Swing Library for GUI.
